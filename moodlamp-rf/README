This is a modified fnordlicht firmware by Tobias Schneider
(schneider@blinkenlichts.net).

It adds a more useful RC5 interface to control the lamp via
an infrared remote control.

Most of the added code goes to the static scripts and the rc5 handler.
The main loop contains a new state machine which controls the global
behavior of the lamp.

A list of features:
    -Dimming the lamp.
    -Powering down the lamp and resuming at the same state.
    -Storing default values in the internal eeprom, which are used at start up.
    -Selection of the running script.
    -Pausing the running script.
    -Adjusting the speed of the script running.
    -A sleep timer which dims the lamp over a period of time to zero brightness.
    -The RGB value can be directly modified by the remote.
     If this is used while the lamp is paused, any color can be selected.

Changes in the source:
    -The original RC5 decoder is replaced by Peter Dannegers code.
    -The speed adjustment is more thoroughly implemented.
    -The PWM values are scaled by a dimming value.
    -The RC5 commands are handled in a new module(rc5_handler.c)
    -The standard avr-lib makefile is used.
    -The pin for the RC5 receiver changed. This is due to the chosen layout.
     With the new RC5 lib this can be changed to any pin.
